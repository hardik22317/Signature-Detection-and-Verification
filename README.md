# Signature-detection-verification
This repository contains files of Computer Vision project of Group 6.

Signature_Detection folder contains codes for different approaches:<br> Contour features-based, OCR + Connected Components labelling, OCR + LineSweeping algorithm.<br><br>
Signature_verification folder contains codes for SVM and ANN classification.

Usage:
1. Navigate to folder whose approach you want to run.<br>
  For OCR approach - run 'acheque.py'<br>
  For Connected Components approach - run 'cclabel.py'<br>
  For LineSweep algorithm, run 'lineSweepDetect.py'<br>
  For Contour feature based algorithm, run 'signature_detection.py'.

2. For execution of signature verification approaches,<br>
  For SVM based classification, run 'run.py' <br>
  For ANN based classification, run 'test.py'
